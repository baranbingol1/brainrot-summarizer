## Example

Input : [Attention Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)

Output (text) :

Yo, so this paper *Attention Is All You Need* is like the ultimate glow-up for neural networks. They dropped the Transformer, which is basically the GOAT of sequence transduction no cap! It's all about that attention magic, ditching the boring old recursions and convolutions like they're cheugy. 

Now, it's all fast and furious, hitting those training times like a boss. Peep these stats: it's flexing a 28.4 BLEU on English-to-German and a whopping 41.8 BLEU on English-to-French. Talk about bussinï¿½! Plus, it's slaying in English constituency parsing too. 

The whole vibe is stacked self-attention and point-wise feed-forward layers, like a whole squad of multi-head attention just vibin' together. This setup is peak computational efficiency and translation quality, throwing shade at the old models. Pretty sus if you ask me, but we stan it! Periodt!
